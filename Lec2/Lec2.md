## Finite, Countable, Uncountable Sets

### Basic definition

- Function:

- Map:

  1. Image
  2. Map onto
  3. Inverse image
  4. One-to-one Map

- Equivalent relationship: reflexive, symmetric, transitive

- finite/infinite/countable/uncountable:

- Sequence:

- Countable set is the "smallest" infinity

### sets

- *union, intersection, intersect, disjoint*
- *union, intersection & sum, multiplication*
- The set of a sequence of countable sets, is countable

### Example

- Let A be the set of all integers, A is countable.
- A is infinite if  A is equivalent to its proper subset.
- A is a countable set, B is a set of all n-tuples where elements of tuples are from a, Then b is countable.
